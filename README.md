# odin-landingpage
Here is a landing page that has been created following the template provided by The Odin Project. This project uses HTML and CSS that I was taught by the information given to me by The Odin Project.

I have created this to show that anything is possible with a little time and effort. Anyone with a bit of time on their hands can go through The Odin Project course and within a couple days be able to create a page like this. 

I can't wait to see what else I can create as I continue to go through this course.
